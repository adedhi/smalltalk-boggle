This is a short Smalltalk program that plays the Boggle word game for a board of size NxN and a list of words. It uses an efficient algorithm to find and return a dictionary containing the set of adjacent points from the board that form a valid word (you can read more about Boggle [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle)). This program was created for a project in the CPS506: Comparative Programming Languages course at Toronto Metropolitan University.
